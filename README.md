# Road map
- [x] Create a simple working blog engine with one admin.
- [ ] Update nuget packages and js plugins.
- [ ] Implement another grid view, probably Datatables.
- [ ] Complete missing tests.
- [ ] Use EF6 instead of NHibernate
- [ ] Use log4net or NLog instead of ELMAH.
- [ ] Integrate a RBAC system with roles like admin, author etc.
- [ ] Secure the application with help of [John Staveley's Security Essentials Project](https://github.com/johnstaveley/SecurityEssentials)
- [ ] Optionaly, use an AOP framework like [Postsharp](https://www.postsharp.net/), [PureSharp](https://github.com/Virtuoze/Puresharp) etc. for logging etc. management
