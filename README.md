# Road map
- [ ] Create a simple working blog engine with one admin.
- [ ] Use EF6 instead of NHibernate
- [ ] Integrate a RBAC system with roles like admin, poster etc.
- [ ] Secure the application with help of [John Staveley's Security Essentials Project](https://github.com/johnstaveley/SecurityEssentials)
- [ ] Use an AOP framework like [Postsharp](https://www.postsharp.net/), [PureSharp](https://github.com/Virtuoze/Puresharp) etc. for logging etc. management
